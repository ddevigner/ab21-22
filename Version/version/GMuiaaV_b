EXT./INT.  
    TAXI CAB - MORNING                                        1

    DEADPOOL, in full DRESS REDS and MASK, quietly FIDGETS in the
    BACK SEAT of a TAXI CAB as it proceeds along a CITY FREEWAY.

    Deadpool adjusts the two KATANAS strapped to his back. Rolls
    the WINDOWS up, down, up. Tries futilely to untwist the
    seatbelt, then LUNGES forward, locking it up. Rifles through
    a tourist booklet and tears out a HAUNTED SEGWAY TOUR coupon.
    The CABBIE, young, thin, brown, glances back and forth from
    the rear view to the road to the rear view.

                          DEADPOOL
                Kinda lonesome back here.

    CUT TO: DEADPOOL, WEDGING himself through the opening
    between the back seat and front. His two katanas don't
    cooperate, catching on the Plexiglas, stalling him mid-torso.
