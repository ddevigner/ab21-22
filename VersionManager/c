Narrator
One day, an unmanned cabin cruiser was spotted. The boat was in perfect working order, and there were no signs of an attack.

Abroad, there were only three half-full cups of coffee, and on deck, a steel box, which had been opened with an acetylene torch.

The box was empty, and strangely, it had two compartments, as if designed to shelter something.

It was thought to have contained treasure, but after a few months, it was forgotten.
